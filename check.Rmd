# okay so need to account for the discrepancy btwn zip2 and campatt2 - done! they all seem to have no campaign pages
#then figure out discrepancy btwn campatt2 ad dhist2  - done! none of these seem to have donations

```{r}
nrow(zip2) - nrow(campatt2) #difference in number of camps
missingcamps <- anti_join(zip2, campatt2, by = "X")
missingcamps  #okay all of these campaigns lead to a campaign not found page so this seems fine
```

```{r}
nrow(campatt2)
dhist2check <- dhist2 %>% group_by(urlsolid) %>% summarise(donations = n())
nrow(dhist2check)
head(dhist2check)
```

```{r}
campatt2 <- campatt2 %>% rename(urlsolid = urlname) 
missingcamps2 <- anti_join(campatt2, dhist2check, by = "urlsolid")  
missingcamps2
